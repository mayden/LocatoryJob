# Locatory.com Task

## Introduction
Hey, I was tasked to do Roman-Arabic Numeral converter that will be wide scalable.

## Scalability
I decided to use the following features to make my app scalable as possible.
- Zend Framework: Provides us an advanced Model-View-Controller(MVC) implementation that can be used to establish a basic structure for our app. In this manner, we can add more Modules, Services and make our app great!
- Base Testing: When we have tests, our system is easy to operate, maintain and update. Problems should be easy to diagnose.

## Converter
For the architectural basics, I've created Converter module. The advantages are vast, particularly now we can easily add more numeral converters without any major changes. Just adding method.

Moreover, I've added the select option for scalability reasons: currently, we can only choose the 'Arabic' option (as I tasked), but if we want to add another convert so we easily adding another option.

## Time
10 minutes - Analyze the Task

25 minutes - Setup the environment (Zend Framework, PHP Local Server, CLI Tools and etc)

1.5 hour - Programming and learning Zend Framework.

Prior the task, I wasn't familiar with Zend, so I had to learn it during the task. It took from me the majority of time.

## Run it
``` composer serve```
